## 🎯 Tips for Success

### Essential Strategies
- 🎣 **Upgrade Early** - Better rods = more catches, less escapes
- 🪱 **Use Premium Bait** - Master Bait (+50% rarity) is worth the investment
- 🌩️ **Storm Fishing** - Rare/Legendary fish spawn 1.5x more during storms
- 🌙 **Night & Dawn/Dusk** - Best times for Legendary and Mythical fish
- 💰 **Don't Sell Everything** - Keep special mutations and rare fish for trophy room

### Stat Allocation
- **Balanced Build**: 3/3/4 (good for beginners)
- **Lucky Fisher**: 2/6/2 (maximize rare catches)
- **Skilled Angler**: 5/2/3 (never miss a catch)
- **Patient Master**: 2/2/6 (easiest mini-games)

### Skill Tree Priority
1. **Master Angler** (catch rate) - Prevents fish from escaping before mini-game
2. **Rare Finder** (rare spawn) - More legendary/mythical encounters
3. **Quick Reflexes** (mini-game ease) - Easier to actually catch fish
4. **Iron Grip** (XP gain) - Faster leveling
5. **Lucky Fisherman** (mutations) - Golden/Magical fish worth 5-10x more
6. **Bargain Hunter** (sell price) - Extra profit

### Money Making
- Focus on Rare+ fish (100+ coins)
- Golden mutations = 5x base value
- Magical mutations = 10x base value
- Don't sell until esky is full for efficiency
- Complete quests for bonus income
